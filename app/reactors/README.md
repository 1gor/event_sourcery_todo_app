# Reactors

Reactors listen for events and take some action. Often these actions will involve emitting other events into the store. Sometimes it may involve triggering side effects in external systems.

Reactors can be used to build [process managers or sagas](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj591569.aspx).
